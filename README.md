# Collection of DS projects
This repository hosts various notebooks out of my recent Data Analysis and Data Science projects. <br>

1. [EnCicla load balance](https://github.com/moritzgeiger/portfolio/blob/master/EnCicla_load_balance.ipynb)

This notebook deals with a predictive model for bike demands for a bike rental company in Medellin, CO.
The preliminary analysis gives a broad insight on the rental logs with over 14m rows.

The notebook was created as part of one of four challenges at the [WorldDataLeague](https://www.worlddataleague.com/)

2. [Count metal sheets](https://github.com/moritzgeiger/portfolio/blob/master/Count_metal_sheets.ipynb)

This notebook tries to find a model to count the amount of stacked metal sheets on pallets through image recognition. The data set provides ~ 100 images of metal sheet stacks.

3. [Artist recommender](https://github.com/moritzgeiger/portfolio/blob/master/Artist_recommender.ipynb)

A short guide to a simple music artist recommender app. The data set of over 1m rows is accessible on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks).

The recommender was pushed to Heroku and can be accessed here: [Artist Recommender](artist-recommender.herokuapp.com/). Try it yourself :)
