# Collection of DS projects
This repository hosts various notebooks out of my recent Data Analysis and Data Science projects. <br>

1. [EnCicla load balance](EnCicla_load_balance.ipynb)

This notebook deals with a predictive model for bike demands for a bike rental company in Medellin, CO.
The preliminary analysis gives a broad insight on the rental logs with over 14m rows.

The notebook was created as part of one of four challenges at the [WorldDataLeague](https://www.worlddataleague.com/)

---------------------------------

2. [Facebook ads analysis](fb_ads_analysis.ipynb)

Analysing performances of Facebook ad campaigns. Giving recommendations on how to get the best performance out of the campaigns.

The targeted feature is the ```conversion``` of the listed ads. A similar data set can be found here: [Kaggle source](https://www.kaggle.com/loveall/clicks-conversion-tracking)

---------------------------------

3. [Count metal sheets (unfinished)](Count_metal_sheets.ipynb)

This notebook tries to find a model to count the amount of stacked metal sheets on pallets through image recognition. The data set provides ~100 images of metal sheet stacks.

The notebook is currently in progress. Most of the preprocessing is done so far.

4. [Artist recommender](Artist_recommender.ipynb)

A short guide to a simple music artist recommender app. The data set of over 1m rows is accessible on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks).

The recommender was pushed to Heroku and can be accessed here: [Artist Recommender](https://artist-recommender.herokuapp.com/). The user can type an artist and get 3 artist recommendations relevant to the given musician. Try it yourself :)
